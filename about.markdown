Im a coder that likes JS, Python, C++, Java, Golang, C and thats it. 
I tend to do work on backend, however I can make js apps.
Most of the time my work will be done in either JS or Python and then ported to a faster language.
I love learning new things.  
Math is my strongsuit when it comes to these kinds of things.
