What is shadertoy?  
Well, according to the internet, a great way to get into 3D graphics is to make a shadertoy.  
I started off in JS, and I hope to get this a bit further than its current primitive stage.  
As of now, it has the following "features":  

 - A light source thats movable
 - A camera
 - Handling of multiple spheres
 - Relatively efficient.

ShaderToy itself is a raytracer built in JS.
